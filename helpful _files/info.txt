Hello Mat,

I want to sincerely apologize for missing our scheduled interview. Unfortunately, there was a sudden electricity outage in my area, which is a common issue in Cameroon, and it prevented me from being able to attend. I regret not being able to inform you sooner due to the unexpected nature of the situation.

I am very interested in the opportunity to join MavenCode and am eager to discuss how my background aligns with the role. If possible, I would be grateful if we could reschedule our conversation at a time that works best for you.

Thank you for your understanding, and I apologize again for any inconvenience caused.

Hi Pokam,

Awesome!

I have a task for you before the interview.: please build a fully responsive dashboard with reactjs and login capabilities and make the data on the dashboard dynamic with redux and sagas. The template is attached. This will help gauge your skills and compatibility. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

To create a repo I need a good repo name and the description I will put for the repo(a name that will be used even when applying other jobs as well) . I have sent the email already and I will create the firebase project to deploy the live frontend there as well. I think you can start working immediately after you give me these infos I will also like us to have more than just a single dashboard page what if we have other pages as well bu is it really necccessary...?

I think we should use vite with typescript no javascript unless really neccessary and also use tailwind css I have created the default project using vite and added tailwind css to the project you can make the required modifications from there
