Nice — good opportunity. Below I give you:

1. A short, professional reply you can send to Mat right away (copy/paste).
2. 4 quick clarifying questions to include.
3. A practical checklist / plan to follow while you build the task so you don’t miss anything, and what to include when you submit.

### 1) Reply to Mat (copy & paste)

Subject: Re: Task for React Developer role

Hi Mathew —

Thanks — I’m still very interested and I’d be happy to complete the exercise. Before I start I have a few quick questions so I can deliver exactly what you expect (see below). Once confirmed I’ll start working and share a public GitHub repo + live demo (Netlify/Vercel) for review.

Thanks,

### 2) Clarifying questions (include these in the same message)

1. **Deadline** — What is your preferred deadline for this task?
2. **Authentication** — Do you want a simple JWT-based login (mocked users) or an OAuth/social login? Any preference on backend (I can mock endpoints or use a small Express server)?
3. **Data source** — Should the dashboard use mocked/local JSON data or do you expect API endpoints (I can provide a small mock server / static JSON)?
4. **Redux vs alternatives** — You asked for Redux + Sagas — do you require saga middleware specifically, or is Redux Toolkit with RTK Query acceptable?

(If you prefer, I can propose an approach and timeline after you confirm the above.)

### 3) Build checklist & what reviewers expect (follow this while you work)

**Tech / infra (recommended)**

* React (v18+), functional components + hooks
* Redux (Redux Toolkit) + redux-saga (implement requested sagas)
* React Router for routing (login → dashboard)
* Tailwind CSS or plain CSS to match the template (use the template assets they provided)
* Simple mock backend: Express or json-server for auth & dynamic data (or static JSON if they prefer)
* Deploy demo to Netlify/Vercel and push code to a **public GitHub repo**

**Core features (minimal deliverable)**

* Responsive dashboard UI that matches the provided template
* Login page + protected routes (user must be logged in to view dashboard)
* Dynamic data on the dashboard powered by Redux state and sagas (fetch + update flows)
* Basic form validation on login
* Clean folder structure (components, pages, store/sagas, services/api)
* README with run & deploy instructions

**Quality & extras (will make the submission stand out)**

* Clear README: overview, how to run locally, demo link, notes on design choices
* Provide a small set of unit/integration tests (optional but valuable)
* Linting (ESLint) + Prettier config (optional)
* Accessibility checks: semantic HTML, alt tags, keyboard nav
* Small GIF or short video demo in the repo README (screenshots help)
* Short commit history with meaningful messages and a final PR/branch

**Submission format**

* Public GitHub repo with clear README
* Live demo link (Netlify/Vercel) + branch name to check (e.g., `feature/dashboard-task`)
* Optional: single ZIP with build if they request

### 4) A few quick tips while you build

* Keep the implementation functional before polishing visuals — reviewers value working features.
* Use mocked data with a clear service layer so swapping to real APIs is trivial.
* Implement minimal login (store token in memory or localStorage) — indicate security caveats in README.
* If asked about time: provide a realistic delivery window *you* can meet.

---

If you want, I can:

* edit the reply message to be shorter/more casual for WhatsApp, or
* draft the README template you should use in the repo, or
* propose a concrete 3–day implementation plan you can paste into the message to Mat.

Which of those would you like next?
